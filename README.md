### Summary of App Requirements and Goals  
The app I developed is an **Event Tracker** designed for users in hospitality and event planning. It allows users to create, edit, and view events. The main goal was to simplify event management and meet user needs for tracking details like event name, meeting room, notes, and more.

### UI Screens and Features  
The app includes:
- Login and registration screens  
- Home screen showing event listings  
- Event creation and editing screens  
- Bottom navigation bar with:
  - Account Info  
  - Change Password  
  - Logout  

The design focused on clarity, simplicity, and accessibility. Layouts are consistent, buttons are easy to find, and users can quickly perform core actions.

### Coding Approach  
I used:
- **Fragments** to manage UI screens  
- **SQLite** for local data storage  
- **SharedPreferences** to store login info  

Each class was kept modular to separate responsibilities. This structure helps with debugging and scaling. I plan to use this pattern in future apps.

### Testing and Debugging  
I used the **Android Emulator** for testing. I:
- Set breakpoints  
- Used `Log.d()` for checking values  
- Verified event data stored and displayed correctly  

Testing helped ensure the app worked without crashes and all key features behaved as expected.

### Overcoming Challenges  
One challenge was passing data between activities and fragments. I had to learn how to use **Intents** and **SharedPreferences** together effectively. Fixing this helped improve app flow and data consistency.

### Strongest Component  
The **event creation and editing** features were the strongest part of the app. They showed my ability to:
- Design input forms  
- Store and update data in SQLite  
- Reflect changes in the UI

This section demonstrates my skills in Android architecture, user-centered design, and full-stack mobile development.
